## About Me

I am a researcher in Computer Science with a primary focus on understanding user experience and human cognition to enhance human-computer interaction and improve well-being. My research journey mainly revolves around empirical user studies in Virtual Reality (VR) and the use of objective indicators, such as physiological and motion capture features. 

I am currently a Research Scientist jointly at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) in the [Probabilistic Computing Lab](https://bcs.mit.edu/), directed by [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/), and in the [Quest For Intelligence](https://quest.mit.edu/about/vision-statement) initiative (you can find the leadership details of this project [here](https://quest.mit.edu/about/leadership)). Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [ETH Z√ºrich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), in Switzerland, in the Sensing, Perception, and Interaction Lab ([SIPLAB](https://siplab.org/)), directed by [Christian Holz](https://www.christianholz.net/). Prior to this, I did my PhD on the topic of Mental Workload exploitation in VR jointly at [INRIA Rennes](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-rennes-university), in [Anatole L√©cuyer](https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Anatole.Lecuyer/)'s group, and in the private institute of research and technologies [b-com](https://b-com.com/en).
