We created an exciting tower defense game to learn about the immunity system set in a vibrant, cartoonish VR environment over the course of **two weeks**.

Players placed immune system cells and strategically deployed T-cell weapons to fend off waves of attacking bacteria and viruses. 

We unfortunately didn't capture many visuals of the project (just know that we designed some awesome shaders to create a kid-friendly aesthetic that we were really proud of). 
(You can glimpse at the silhouette of some of the cells I modelled in the poster above). 

Check out a sample of the visuals with this cool natural killer cell designed by our teammate, Edouard, [here](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/KdJro). 

I'll update this page with more project materials if they become available.
