abstract: 'In this paper, we propose 3D user interfaces (3DUI) that are adapted to specific Virtual Reality (VR) tasks: climbing a ladder using a puppet metaphor, piloting a drone thanks to a 3D virtual compass and stacking 3D objects with physics-based manipulation and time control. These metaphors have been designed to provide the user with an intuitive, playful and efficient way to perform each task.'
